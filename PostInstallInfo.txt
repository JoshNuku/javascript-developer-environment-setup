Setup Completed!

Thank you for using the JavaScript Developer Environment Setup.

You can now start using your installed tools to build modern web applications.

Some tips:
- Restart your computer if some tools do not work immediately.
- Open VSCode and install any additional extensions you need.
- For MongoDB, make sure the service is running before connecting.

Happy coding! - Josh
